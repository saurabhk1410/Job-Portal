# What I Built

I created a fully responsive Job Portal named CodeRound using React, DaisyUI, Tailwind CSS. The portal allows users to browse job opportunities, save jobs, apply for them, and manage a personal profile. It includes pages for job listings, saved/applied jobs, user profile, contact, notifications, and a dark/light theme switcher. All data is stored locally for now.
# Thought Process & Assumptions

My goal was to build a clean and simple UI for a job application platform. Since no backend was used, I stored user details like profile info and job applications in localStorage.Dummy data is used throughout for jobs, testimonials, etc., with the idea that this would later be connected to a backend/API.
